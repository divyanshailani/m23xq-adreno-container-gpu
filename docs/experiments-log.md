## 2026-08-27 — EXP-000: fastfetch GPU visibility

**Goal:** make fastfetch show the GPU in the container.

**Result:** PARTIAL / explained-away.

- `enable_gpu_mode=0 -> 1` in container.config: mirrors renderD128. Required
  container restart to take effect.
- `mknod /dev/dri/card0 c 226 0` inside container: makes sysfs enumeration happy.
- `apt install libdrm2 mesa-utils`: needed, base image had no graphics stack.
- fastfetch then shows `GPU: Mesa llvmpipe` — the software fallback.

**Learning:** on this 4.19 kernel the DRM nodes are the display pipe (mdss_mdp),
not the GPU. Adreno lives on kgsl. Stock Mesa cannot use kgsl → llvmpipe is
expected. fastfetch is the wrong success metric; Phase 1 (lfdevs Mesa) is the
real path. See docs/01 and docs/02.

## 2026-08-27 — EXP-001: lfdevs Mesa KGSL install (pending)

Plan documented in docs/02; execution next session.
